# Transfer_Learning_SHM


##Greetings! This directory contains three Jupyter notebooks. One is designed to train GAN using FFT data, another performs Transfer Learning between two structures to obtain the ROC curves presented in the paper, and the third performs Binary SDD. To run these codes, please click on the next buttons to be automatically directed to Google Collaboratory. If you have any concerns or questions regarding the notebooks, please do not hesitate to contact me (soleimanisam92@g.ucla.edu). I have compiled all the models again and uploaded them here on Github, so there might be slight differences in results.
